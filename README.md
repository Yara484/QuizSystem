# QuizSystem is a program written to include the basic concepts of object oriented programming in Java and how it can be used in a real
application. It includes: classes, objects, abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism etc.

The program asks the user for name and ID which are stored in the id file and if the info matches then it moves on to choosing the module
then taking the quiz then displaying the grade achieved.
